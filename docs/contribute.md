# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `thebe`, your contributions are welcome and appreciated ðŸŽ‰. This page contains some information to help you get started.

```{note}
`thebe` was recently called `thebelab`, so you may see mentions of `thebelab` scattered throughout the repository. Feel free to flag these and suggest we rename them to `thebe`.
```

## Contributing guide

See the [ExecutableBooks developer guidelines](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/contributing.html) for conventions and practices around developing `thebe`. However, note that some practices, such as creating releases, may be different because `thebe` is primarily an `npm` package rather than a Python package.

## Repository structure

`thebe` is primarily written in Javascript, and structured as an NPM package.

- `src/` contains the code and assets that make up `thebe`. This is what you'll edit to make changes to the project.
- `examples/` provides a few HTML examples of how `thebe` can be used. It is mostly for documentation

(dev-install)=

## Set up a development environment

In order to get Thebe running locally, you'll need to have Node installed on your system. You can install it in several ways, the most common being:

- Install Node by [following the nodejs instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install Node through `conda`

  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
  ```

Once installed, this also includes `npm` (Node Package Manager) which is what you will run in order to run Thebe locally.

Next, clone the repository and set up your `npm` environment for this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe
cd thebe
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies needed to run `thebe` (specified in `package.json`).

## Build and demo `thebe` locally

To use your local copy of `thebe` (e.g., if you make any changes to the `src/` folder), you can run a local build and serve a sample web page. To do so, run:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

This will build `thebe/` locally (including any changes you've made to the source code).

You can now demo the latest `thebe/` changes by opening the file at `development/binder.html`. Open this file to see Thebe running.

The content of `development/binder.html` is a simple HTML page that demonstrates Thebe functionality. You can edit it to test out new features or configurations.

Running the `npm run develop` command will start a watch on the source code, building with webpack and will serve it along with `development/binder.html`.
As you change the code in `src/`, the javascript will automatically be re-built, but you'll be required to refresh the page.

### Using a local kernel

`development/binder.html` will connect to a public binder instance which can be slow.

For faster development and easy control over the python environment available to Jupyter is run `npm run develop:local` instead.

This will serve the file from `development/local.html` which will attempt to connect to a local Jupyter kernel.

You will need to have Jupyter running with **the expected authentication token** for this to work. i.e.

```bash
jupyter notebook \
  --NotebookApp.token=thebe-test-secret \
  --NotebookApp.allow_origin='http://127.0.0.1:8080'
```

## Committing changes

Thebe uses code autoformatting so you don't need to worry about style lint,
so whenever you are ready to commit changes
run `npm run fmt` to autoformat the javascript.
You can put this script in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [[ -f package.json ]]; then
    npm run fmt
fi
```

to run auto-formatting prior to each commit.

## Testing Thebe

You can test manually, interactively by running `npm run develop` to open and serve `development.html` with the current build of thebe.

### Running automated tests

There are two types of automated test environment in place in thebe both using the Jest testing library. These are:

1.  a standard javascript testing setup for unit / component level testing of the thebe library. These can be run using `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` and test code is located in the `test` folder.
2.  e2e style tests using jest + puppeteer that can be run `npm run test:e2e` or `npm run test:e2e:watch` and test code is located in the `e2e` folder.

Alternately, you can push your changes to GitHub and let the tests run automatically via GitHub Actions.

TODO: get testing infrastructure to a point where we can reasonably request tests for new features.

#### Adding unit tests

Unit style tests work by loading the thebe library or part of it in javascript; mocking inputs and/or dependencies, executing a function and asserting on outputs of mocks. A good first example to look at is `tests/bootstrap.spec.js`. This test:

- loads thebe js code `import * as thebelab from "../src/thebelab";`
- manipulates the dom to prep the test (via built in JSDOM)
- calls the `thebe.bootstrap()` function
- checks for expected behaviour

If you are new to Jest check their [getting started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started), [mocking](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions) and [expect assertion api](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect) docs.

#### Adding e2e Tests

e2e style tests are achieved using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) a headless chrome api that can be used to load a page complete with thebe scripts, allowing full execution as though it was in an end user browser and then assertion of end state.

Adding new e2e tests involves:
(see `e2e/readonly.test.js` for an example)

- creating a test html page that load and uses thebe, placing this in the `e2e/fixtures/HTML` folder
- load the fixture page at the start of your test

```
  beforeAll(async () => {
   await page.goto(
     `file:${path.join(__dirname, "/fixtures/HTML/readonly1.html")}`,
     { waitUntil: ["load", "domcontentloaded", "networkidle0"] }
   );
 });
```

- Assert on initial page state
- Invoke UI actions to trigger behavior
- assert on final state

## Building docs locally

Thebe uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/) for building documentation. Thebe documentation is located in the `/docs` directory.
You will need the development environment setup, see the above {ref}`dev-install` to learn more.
You will also need Python installed, and can install the requirements for the documentation using:

```bash
cd docs/
pip install -r doc-requirements.txt
```

Once you are in the documentation folder:

```bash
make html
```

Finally, run the following to view the built documentation locally:

```bash
make show
```

## Releasing Thebe

To release thebe, follow the [EBP guidelines](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/contributing.html#releases-and-change-logs) to make sure the repo is ready for release.

Once prepared, bump the version with:

1. Use npm to update the thebe version in the `package.json` file and to create
   a git tag for the version using `npm version NEW_VERSION`, e.g. `npm version 0.5.1`
2. Push the tag to github: `git push --follow-tags`
3. Create a release for the new tag on github at
   https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/releases/new; this will trigger a
   github action that uploads the latest version to unpkg.com/browse/thebe/.

## Thebe architecture

Thebe consumes three principal APIs:

1. [jQuery][] for manipulating elements on the page
2. [JupyterLab][] for talking to a running Jupyter server to execute code and display outputs
3. [BinderHub][] for requesting kernels from a BinderHub instance, such as mybinder.org.

### Manipulating the page

The first thing Thebe does is find elements on the page
that should be made executable.
It does this with [jQuery][],
finding (by default) elements that look like `<div data-executable="true">...`,
with a query such as the `$("[data-executable])` (this is the default, but can be customized).
Once it has found these elements,
Cell objects are created (more on Cells in the JupyterLab API), which then _replace_ the elements that were found.

### JupyterLab APIs

The main thing Thebe does is execute code and display output.
This is done with JupyterLab APIs.
A Cell is an element wrapping a code input area and associated OutputArea for displaying the outputs that result from execution.

Main APIs used:

- OutputArea for rendering outputs on the page
- Session for starting kernels
- Kernel for sending/receiving messages to/from a connected kernel
- WidgetManager for working with interactive widgets

### Configuration

Configuration is handled by adding a `script` tag with type="text/x-thebe-config". This should specify a javascript object.

More information in the README (TODO: move it here?)

```html
<script type="text/x-thebe-config">
  {
    binderOptions: {
      repo: "minrk/ligo-binder",
      ref: "master",
    }
  }
</script>
```
